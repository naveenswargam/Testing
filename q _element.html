    <q>If you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy and inspires your hopes</q>
    <p>When we are faced with difficult times as we are now with the effects of a worldwide pandemic, it is easy to get discouraged and lose hope.
    <br>
    <q>Hope is a vital component of human existence, and it is needed to find happiness and peace during times that might otherwise lead us to be discouraged.</q>
    <br>
    As Andrew Carnegie so clearly pointed out, setting a goal can keep your thoughts focused, direct your energy, and inspire the hope that is needed to move through and beyond a moment of despair.</p>
